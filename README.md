# Portfolio Website
A portfolio website built using Angular and ASP.NET Core technologies, designed to showcase projects, experience, and personal information in a responsive and secure way.
## Project Overview
This project is a full-stack portfolio website featuring a dynamic front end developed with Angular and a secure, RESTful API backend using ASP.NET Core. The backend implements clean architecture principles, ensuring a scalable and maintainable structure, while the frontend provides an interactive user experience using Angular components and Bootstrap styling.
## Technologies Used
### Backend
- **.NET Core API**: Powers the backend logic and handles HTTP requests.
- **Entity Framework (EF) Core**: Manages data access and performs object-relational mapping (ORM).
- **Code First**: Defines database structure using code.
- **Migration**: Ensures seamless database updates as the data model evolves.
- **Generic Repository Pattern**: Provides a generic approach to data access, reducing redundancy.
- **Clean Architecture**: Separates concerns, making the application more maintainable.
- **RESTful API**: Enables smooth data exchange between the client and server.
- **BasicAuthAttribute**: Adds a layer of basic authentication for securing API endpoints.
### Frontend
- **Angular**: Develops the client interface, making it a responsive single-page application (SPA).
- **Bootstrap**: Styles the frontend for a responsive and modern design.
## Features
- **Project and Experience Display**: Sections to showcase projects and experiences, easily managed through the API.
- **Clean and Modular Codebase**: Following Clean Architecture and Angularâ€™s modular structure for scalable development.
- **Secure API**: Basic authentication ensures only authorized requests access sensitive endpoints.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes using Bootstrap.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Navigation is handled by Angular Router, allowing seamless transitions between pages.
